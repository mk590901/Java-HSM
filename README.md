# Java HSM App
Is demonstrates the use and access to HSM elements in a Java application.

## Goal
A page, conventionally called the compilation service, has been added to the HSM editor (currently a private project - https://github.com/mk590901/qhsm_editor_app, linkedin - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-kanzieper-52931612_hsm-dart-flutter-activity-7241391192653938689-DUiV/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). It is designed to translate the HSM graphical scheme into the target code. At the moment, two compilers are implemented: for dart and for java. An example of using this code in dart applications is the project https://github.com/mk590901/Touch-Tracker. This project discusses the use of automatically generated code in a Java app for Android.
